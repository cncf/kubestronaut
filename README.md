## Listing Format

The [people.json file](https://github.com/cncf/people/blob/main/people.json) lists all people in alphabetical order by name.  Add new entries in the right place in the list.  Not all fields are used by each listing.  This is the format used for Kubestronaut:

```json
    {
        "name":"Full name of person",
        "bio":"Full bio of person. Use html markup when needed.",
        "company":"Company and/or title",
        "pronouns":"Personal pronouns",
        "location":"A Google Maps readable name of city, state, country",
        "linkedin":"LinkedIn url",
        "twitter":"Twitter url",
        "github":"GitHub url",
        "wechat":"Wechat url",
        "website":"Personal website",
        "youtube":"YouTube url",
        "priority":Value to diffentiate between other entries in an ordered list; omit this entry in most cases,
        "languages":[Array of languages spoken],
        "category":[Array of categories the person belongs to],
        "email": "person!example.com",
        "slack_id": "U123ABC456",
        "image":"Image filename from the /images/ directory"
    }
```

And here is an example entry:

```json
    {
        "name":"Johnny Appleseed",
        "bio":"John Chapman (September 26, 1774 â€“ March 18, 1845), better known as Johnny Appleseed, was an American pioneer nurseryman who introduced apple trees to large parts of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania'>Pennsylvania</a>, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Ontario, as well as the northern counties of present-day West Virginia.",
        "company":"Apples R Us",
        "pronouns":"he/him",
        "location":"Portland, Maine, United States",
        "linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnny-appleseed/",
        "twitter":"https://twitter.com/jappleseed",
        "github":"https://github.com/jappleseed",
        "wechat":"https://web.wechat.com/jappleseed",
        "website":"https://jappleseed.com",
        "youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/c/jappleseed",
        "priority":10,
        "languages":["Spanish","English"],
        "category":["Kubestronaut"],
        "email": "johnny!example.com",
        "slack_id": "U123ABC456",
        "image":"jappleseed.jpg"
    }
```

## Images

Upload your headshot image to the `/images/` directory with a filename made up of your name.  Images should be at least 500x500px, 72dpi, and should be in JPG format with file size less than 100kB.

## Team Management

Also within this repo is a YAML file used by our [automation tooling](https://github.com/electron/sheriff) to help us manage access to resources for teams. This tooling takes advantage of data in [people.json](people.json) such as the `email` and `slack_id` fields. This will allow us to add maintainers to different properties only using their GitHub handle.
