# CNCF Kubestronaut Program FAQ

This file is the Frequently Asked Questions (and their answers) of the [CNCF Kubestronauts](https://www.cncf.io/training/kubestronaut/) program

## How do I become eligible to become a Kubestronaut?

To become a Kubestronaut, you need to pass all Kubernetes-related certifications: CKA, CKAD, CKS, KCNA, and KCSA. All certifications must be current/active (i.e., in good standing, not expired).


## If I don’t have all 5 exams but I have something else (e.g. KCNA, KCSA, PCA, CKA…or any other combination of CNCF exams) am I eligible to become a Kubestronaut?

No. To become a Kubestronaut and get the jacket, you need to have all 5 Kubernetes-related certifications and all must be active certifications. You will have to pass the missing exams to become a Kubestronaut.


## Do all 5 certifications need to be active at the same time? (e.g. my CKA expired last year – I now have an active CKAD/CKS and KCNA).

Yes, all 5 certifications need to be active at the same time.


## Do the 5 certifications have to be achieved during a certain period, or does the list include all eligible candidates since the certifications were launched?

No. The only condition is to have all certifications active, regardless of when they were passed.


## How often will jackets be distributed? How soon after I achieve my fifth certification should I expect to receive my jacket?

Once you successfully pass your 5th certification, a CNCF Staff member will contact you within 30 days to discuss the shipping and size selection of the jacket. The jacket will be distributed to you within 15 days.


## How will jackets be distributed, and who will manage the distribution?

The CNCF staff will make the distribution. CNCF will take care of the shipping details but won’t be able to pay any extra customs fees. If you expect to face such fees, please mention that to the CNCF staff member who will contact you when you successfully pass the 5th certification.


## If I have a question about this promotion OR if I’ve received my jacket and I have a problem (wrong size, etc.), who do I contact?

Please send an email to training@cncf.io.


## What if I don’t want a jacket? Can I get something else?

No. The CNCF Recognition Program will only distribute the exclusive jacket to recognize Kubestronauts.


## How can I get the voucher to attend CNCF events?

As a Kubestronaut in order to get your vouchers to get 20% off a CNCF event (KubeCon or KubeDays) each year, simply contact training@cncf.io and we will be able to give you all the needed elements.


## I have passed some of my certifications in 2 (or more) different Linux Foundation accounts, but it is not possible to merge them. Can I still be a Kubestronaut?

We are aware of this current limitation of our systems, so we are manually taking into consideration the certifications you have across various Linux Foundation accounts. In order to do so, simply contact us at training@cncf.io and provide us the various LFID or email addresses you used, and we should be able to accommodate you.


## Can I use the 50% voucher I have received on any CNCF exam?

Yes you can use the voucher for any CNCF exam that is available even if it was not released when you received the voucher. But keep in mind that those vouchers are for an individual exam only and not applicable to bundles (training course + certification or multi-exam.)


## If I hold 5 certifications and have become a Kubestronaut, if one of my certifications expires, what will happen to my Kubestronaut? Will I then be removed from the website displaying Kubestronauts from all over the world?

Not immediately, you will still be a Kubestronaut until the end of the year. Here is how we are managing the expiration :

* The Kubestronaute title is valid until the end of the year in which their first of the 5 certifications expires.
* Every October, the CNCF sends an expiration reminder to all Kubestronauts whose status expired earlier in the year, and to those whose status will expire before the end of the year.
* Kubestronauts who fail to renew their expired certification before the end of the year will lose their title and all associated benefits.
* Existing Kubestronauts will receive their new voucher certifications in January of each year their status is maintained.


## Is the jacket only given once? Let's say my certs expired and I regained them again at a later date. Am I considered a new Kubestronaut and issued another jacket, vouchers and so on?

As a former Kubestronaut who requalifies, you will once again enjoy the same benefits as all other Kubestronauts, with the exception of the jacket, since a Kubestronaut can only receive one single Kubestronaut jacket during his lifetime.
